```

### Parameters
- `Duration` `(Type: Duration || Flag: Required)`: The duration of this cooldown.
- `Error message` `(Type: String || Flag: Emptiable)`: The message that is returned when the cooldown duration is still ongoing. `%time%` and other related functions can be used here.

### Recommendation
You can also use these functions:
- [`$getCooldown[]`](./getCooldown.md)
- [`$serverCooldown[]`](./serverCooldown.md)
- [`$globalCooldown[]`](./globalCooldown.md)
